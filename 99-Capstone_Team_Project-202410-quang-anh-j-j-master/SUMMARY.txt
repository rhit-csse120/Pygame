2. List the names of the team members for your project.

3. Explain briefly what your project does and how it works.

    The game we created is based on Wii Tanks, a game released in the 2000s. It has two player-controlled tanks; the
    blue one moves when the WASD keys are pressed, and the red one moves when the arrow keys are pressed. The goal of
    each player is to defeat the opponent's tank by shooting bullets (by pressing different keys for each tank). The
    bullets can bounce up to three times when they hit obstacles around the border or on the field. The tanks cannot
    move through obstacles. When a tank is hit by a bullet, its health decreases and will be displayed on its health bar.
    If the health bar reaches zero, the tank will explode, and the remaining player will win.
